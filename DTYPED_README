dependently-typed pipe operator in CPython project

Project description:
https://dtyped.netlify.app/wiki/projects/pipe-in-python/

Adds a pipe operator "|>".

Main modifications:
1. Add pipe token to tokens file for lexer
2. Add pipe syntax to grammar file for AST creation

How to build:

Configure with ./configure script.

Build everything with make. Recommended to add the -j option to speed up making.

Different targets exist which are used for generated portions of CPython (lexer, PEG parser, etc.).

Use target regen-token to regenerate the token lexer if you change tokens.
Use target regen-pegen to regenerate the PEG parser grammar into the parser.c file.

Use the default target (empty/no target parameter) to build CPython.

Run the created ./python executable.
